# Azure Database Migration 

## Project Description
In this project, I was set to architect and implement a cloud-based database system on Microsoft Azure, showcasing hands-on expertise in cloud engineering.

First, began by establishing a production environment database. Subsequently, migrating the database to Azure SQL Database, focusing on crucial aspects like data backup, restoration, and automated scheduling. These efforts strengthened my data management approach.

A pivotal phase of the project involves simulating a disaster recovery scenario with potential data loss. Furthermore, I explored the complexities of geo-replication and failover configuration to ensure data availability even under challenging conditions.

To enhance security, Microsoft Entra ID integration is employed to define access roles, adding an extra layer of control and protection.

This repository will be a detailed documentation channelling different milestones and tasks for the successful completion of this project.
